  As a Senior Software Engineer, I significantly contributed to the British Airways website's accessibility improvements and led multiple redevelopment efforts. My role focused on strategic problem-solving, efficiently managing tasks, and strong communication with upper management to ensure a thorough understanding and fulfilment of team development and training needs. This greatly enhanced project outcomes and team capabilities. Additionally, my work in pioneering new experiments and conducting A/B testing played a crucial role in enhancing sales opportunities, thereby boosting revenue generation.
